@article{constantinople,
 abstract = {Byzantine agreement requires a set of parties in a distributed system toagree on a value even if some parties are maliciously misbehaving. A newprotocol for Byzantine agreement in a completely asynchronous network ispresented that makes use of new cryptographic protocols, specificallyprotocols for threshold signatures and coin-tossing.  These cryptographicprotocols have practical and provably secure implementations in therandom oracle model.  In particular, a coin-tossing protocol based onthe Diffie-Hellman problem is presented and analyzed. The resulting asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocol is both practicaland theoretically optimal because it tolerates the maximum number ofcorrupted parties, runs in constant expected rounds, has message andcommunication complexity close to the optimum, and uses a trusted dealeronly once in a setup phase, after which it can process a virtually unlimitednumber of transactions. The protocol is formulated as a transaction processing service in acryptographic security model, which differs from the standardinformation-theoretic formalization and may be of independent interest.},

 abstract = {Often it is desired that the power to sign or authenticate messages is shared. This paper presents methods to collectively generate RSA signatures, provably secure authenticators and unconditionally secure authenticators. In the new schemes, l individuals are given shares such that k â€ l are needed to generate a signature (authenticator) but less than k can not. When the k people have finished signing (authenticating), nobody can perform an impersonation or substitution attack. These schemes are called threshold signature (authentication) schemes. Clearly these schemes are better than each of the k individuals sending a separate authenticator for each message or if each of the k individuals each send their share to a ``trusted'' person who will sign for them.},

@inproceedings{Ingemarsson1991,
 abstract = {All shared secret or shared control schemes devised thus far are autocratic in the sense that they depend in their realization on the existence of a single party---which may be either an individual or a device---that is unconditionally trusted by all the participants in the scheme [5,6]. The function of this trusted party is to first choose the secret (piece of information) and then to construct and distribute in secret to each of the participants the private pieces of information which are their shares in the shared secret or control scheme. The private pieces of information are constructed in such a way that any authorized concurrence (subset) of the participants will jointly have sufficient information about the secret to reconstruct it while no unauthorized collection of them will be able to do so. For many applications, though, there is no one who is trusted by all of the participants, and in the extreme case, no one who is trusted by anyone else. In the absence of a trusted party or authority, no one can be trusted to know the secret and hence---until now---it has appeared to be impossible to construct and distribute the private pieces of information needed to realize a shared control scheme. It is worth noting that in commercial and/or internation(al) applications, this situation is more nearly the norm than the exception.},

We establish security properties for the protocol comparable to those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. As the protocol provides a ``proof of stake'' blockchain discipline, it offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based on proof of physical resources (e.g., proof of work). We also present a novel reward mechanism for incentivizing Proof of Stake protocols and we prove that, given this mechanism, honest behavior is an approximate Nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing attacks such as selfish mining.},
